To Do
=====

- Player programs keys
    when Launched: shipColor('#FF3388')

    if (isKeyPressed('ArrowLeft')) { rudderPort() }

- I must control the speed of my ship using:
    - throttle
    - mixture
    - turbo

- Round starts and ends after N time

- I can see my score -- distance in the race
